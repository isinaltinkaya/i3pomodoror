# i3pomodoror

i3blocks scripts for pomodoror package written in R by Silas Tittes, working with my fork which can be downloaded from this link:  https://github.com/isinaltinkaya/pomodoror

Change `/path/to/script/` in i3pomodoror.sh with path to script in your system.

Add this to your i3blocks.conf:
```
[i3pomodoror]
command=/path/to/script/i3pomodoror.sh
interval=60
```

Don't forget to change `/path/to/script/` in line 2 with path to script in your system.
